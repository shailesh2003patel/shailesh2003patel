<h1>The Best Movie According To Shailesh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The silent voice</h3>
<p>The visual storytelling is powerful and effective soundtrack,
     you don't even need to read the subtitles to know what the characters are saying. But I felt sad for that girl.
      There is a huge shock in this movie. How people change. How much a person can be loved.
      As a teenager I have much more things to learn. Probably If I'll have time I will watch it twice.
     Even I fall in love with ANIME after watched this.</p>
    <h3>Your name</h3> 
    <p>"Your Name" is an enchanting anime film that captivates audiences with its compelling story,
         stunning visuals, and heartfelt emotions. Directed by Makoto Shinkai, this critically acclaimed
          movie takes viewers on an extraordinary journey of love, fate, and connection.</p>
     <h3>Spirited away</h3> 
     <p>Hayao Miyazaki’s Spirited Away (Released Date : 12 December 2002 ) is a work of magic that you shouldn’t miss.
         It is an unforgettable, thrilling and enchanting anime movie. Easily one of the best movies I’ve ever watched 
         and the best movie in Studio Ghibli. Studio Ghibli is from Japan, and there are many movies from it like Howl’s
          Moving Castle, War Of The Fireflies, Whisper Of The Heart, and My Neighbour Totoro.  You will definitely love 
          Spirited Away if you are an anime fan.
         Even if you hate anime, you need to watch this masterpiece. </p>
